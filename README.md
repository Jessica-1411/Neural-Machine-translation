# Neural-Machine-translation

Developed a web application to translate English sentences to Malayalam leveraging the MarianMT model from the Transformers library. Front end was developed with React.js and the backend was managed using the Flask framework of Python. The user interface consists of two text areas, one to input the English sentence and the other to display the corresponding Malayalam sentence, and a translate button to initiate the translation, clicking on which an http request is sent to the backend to use the model to generate the output which is then fetched back into the interface and displayed.
The project was developed with the aim of utilizing pretrained models to facilitate translation of low resourced language like Malayalam to aid non-Malayalam speakers.
